# NALU
Neural Arithmetic Logic Units by Trask et al.

An implementation of NALU (as proposed in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.00508.pdf)). Implementation includes - 
- NAC
- NALU
- Basic experiments to show how a NALU enabled neural network learns an artihmetic function and extrapolates on it
